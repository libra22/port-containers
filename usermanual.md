This application is navigable via the 5 tabs above. The first tab is this page (**Introduction**). The other 4 tabs provide information as explained above:

***2.1 Tonnage Type***

This tab allows user to select port via a dropdown list, and the application will display  a series of bar graphs with the volume of tonnes by type according to year. This can provide an overview of the particular port performance for the three types of containers. A line graph showing trend over years is also provided below the bar chart.

This tab allows user to select two ports, and the type of container using the dropdown lists. The application will generate a line graph showing comparison between the two ports for the given type.

***2.3 Compare Type by Year***

User has option to view all three types by checking the "Show All Types" box. Furthermore, user can view all the three types as separate graphs by checking the "show as Separated Graph".
